# N-Queens Solver ðŸŽ¯â™›

This project visualizes solutions to the N-Queens problem using two approaches:

- ðŸ§  Backtracking (Exact, All Solutions)
- ðŸ§¬ Genetic Algorithm (Heuristic, One Solution)

Built with:

- Python 3.12+
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Simple, modular architecture

## How to Run

```bash
PS C:\Users\<computer_location>> python main.py
```

## Project Structure

```bash
algorithms/          --> backtracking and genetic solvers core
board_logic_gui/     --> Board logic and GUI elements
main.py              --> Application entry point (Tkinter GUI)
```
